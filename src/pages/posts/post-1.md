Welcome to my _new blog_ where I learn new things constantly! Here, I will share my thoughts and hurdles while learning new technology or topics.

## What I've Accomplished so Far

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project with yarn.
2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by adding them to the correct directory, using the .astro file type.
3. **Making Blog Posts**: Now, I'm making blog posts using MD (Markdown)!

## EOD
I will finish the Astro tutoriral and work on this site as I go.
